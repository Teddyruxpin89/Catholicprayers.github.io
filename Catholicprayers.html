<p class="text1">As men we tend to overlook many of the items we carry. Some of us take the time to preplan, and look at what we need for the day. On our phones we can look at pages offline and keep them on person. Here are some of the best prayers for you and your family.</p>
<p class="text1">Have you stopped by and cared to make time to talk to your mother ? Below a simple yet Powerful Prayer. A necessity to annihilate the forces of evil.</p>

<h2>Hail Mary</h2>
<p class="text2">Hail Mary,full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art thou among women and Blessed is the Fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary Mother of God, Pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.</p>

  <p class="pray">Our Father, Who art in heaven, 
Hallowed be Thy Name. 
Thy Kingdom come. 
Thy Will be done, 
on earth as it is in Heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread. 
And forgive us our trespasses, 
as we forgive those who trespass against us. 
And lead us not into temptation, 
but deliver us from evil. Amen.</p>
